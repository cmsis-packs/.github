# About

This is a project that aims to host [CMSIS](https://www.arm.com/why-arm/technologies/cmsis) packs, providing an easy way to integrate them in git projects as submodules, as well as providing diff and version control for them.

If you need a pack that is not currently available here, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/cmsis-packs/.github/issues) with info about the pack you wish to have, and if possible, a premade [script](https://github.com/cmsis-packs/cmsis-dfp-repo_template/blob/deploy-script/cmsis-deploy.sh) for it.

If a pack exists but is out of date, open a issue in the pack repository or [here](https://github.com/cmsis-packs/.github/issues) with info about the upstream like the version and possibly a link for the pack.

This is an UNOFFICIAL project, not endorsed by ARM or any of the vendors that provide the packs.

All of the packs are distributed unmodified, consult the vendors or ARM about licensing.
