# About

This is a project that aims to host [CMSIS](https://www.arm.com/why-arm/technologies/cmsis) packs, providing an easy way to integrate them in git projects as submodules, as well as providing diff and version control for them.

If you need a pack that is not currently available here, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/cmsis-packs/.github/issues) with info about the pack you wish to have, and if possible, a premade [script](https://github.com/cmsis-packs/cmsis-dfp-repo_template/blob/deploy-script/cmsis-deploy.sh) for it.

If a pack exists but is out of date, open a issue in the pack repository or [here](https://github.com/cmsis-packs/.github/issues) with info about the upstream like the version and possibly a link for the pack.
